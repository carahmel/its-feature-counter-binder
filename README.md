## ITS feature counter

This Binder-ready repository allows the ITSFeatureCounter script to be executed directly from a browser.


## Usage


**[Update 25.09.2024]** If issues are encountered when launching the Binder URL, run the notebook via Google Colab instead:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HK1LcM3JBksQL_H6yllJKyrr-uyC6OI0?usp=sharing

Note that it is necessary to sign in using a Google account in order to run the notebook.

---

Run https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/carahmel/its-feature-counter-binder/HEAD?labpath=ITS-feature-counter.ipynb in your browser and wait for the Binder to finish building the image.

Once complete, JupyterLab will open with the ITS-feature-counter notebook ready to be executed [_Run_ tab > _Run All Cells_].


This notebook is editable within the browser. As such, the path to ich-tanke-strom.ch's JSON file can be updated if necessary.

Results (and interactive map) will printed directly in the notebook.


Example output:
```
STATUS OF CHARGING POINTS:
# Available: 77
# Reserved: 0
# Occupied: 39
# Out of service: 0
# Unknown: 4

TOTAL: 120 charging points across 44 stations
